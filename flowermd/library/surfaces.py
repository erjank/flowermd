class Graphene(System):
    """Create a rectangular graphene layer or multiple layers.

    Parameters
    ----------
    x_repeat : int, required
        Number of times to repeat graphene lattice in the x-direciton.
    y_repeat: int, required
        Number of times to repeat graphene lattice in the y-direciton.
    n_layers: int, optional, default 1
        Number of times to repeat the complete layer in the normal direction.
    force_field: force_field : flowermd.ForceField
        The force field to be applied to the surface for paramaterizaiton.
        Note that setting `force_field` does not actually apply the forcefield
        to the molecule. The forcefield in this step is mainly used for
        validation purposes.
    reference_values : dict, required
        A dictionary of reference values for the surface. The keys of the
        dictionary are "length", "energy", and "mass". The values of the
        dictionary are unyt quantities.
    r_cut : float, required
        The cutoff radius for the Lennard-Jones interactions.
    periodicity : tuple of bools, length=3, optional, default=(True, True, False) # noqa: E501
        Whether the Compound is periodic in the x, y, and z directions.
        If None is provided, the periodicity is set to `(False, False, False)`
        which is non-periodic in all directions.
        auto_scale : bool, default=False
        Set to true to use reduced simulation units.
        distance, mass, and energy are scaled by the largest value
        present in the system for each.
    scale_charges : bool, default False
        Set to true to scale charges to net zero.
    remove_charges : bool, default False
        Set to true to remove charges from the system.
    remove_hydrogens : bool, default False
        Set to true to remove hydrogen atoms from the system.
        The masses and charges of the hydrogens are absorbed into
        the heavy atoms they were bonded to.
    pppm_resolution : tuple, default=(8, 8, 8)
        The resolution used in
        `hoomd.md.long_range.pppm.make_pppm_coulomb_force` representing
        number of grid points in the x, y, and z directions.
    ppmp_order : int, default=4
        The order used in
        `hoomd.md.long_range.pppm.make_pppm_coulomb_force` representing
        number of grid points in each direction to assign charges to.
    nlist_buffer : float, default=0.4
        Neighborlist buffer for simulation cell.

    Notes
    -----
    To create bonds along periodic boundaries of the layers in the x and y
    directions, set `periodicity = (True, True, False)`
