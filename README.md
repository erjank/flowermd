## flowerMD: Flexible Library of Organic Workflows and Extensible Recipes for Molecular Dynamics
flowerMD is a modular “wrapper” package for molecular dynamics (MD)
simulation pipeline development, designed to enable fast, reproducible,
end-to- end simulation workflows with minimal user effort. This package is a
wrapper for [MoSDeF](https://github.com/mosdef-hub) packages and
[Hoomd-Blue](https://github.com/glotzerlab/hoomd-blue) with a focus on
simulating soft matter systems.

An object-oriented design makes flowerMD extensible and highly flexible.
This is bolstered by a library-based approach to system initialization, making
flowerMD agnostic to system identity, forcefield, and thermodynamic
ensemble, and allowing for growth on an as-needed basis.

flowerMD's design allows for creation of modules where an end-to-end interface is designed with a complex task in mind, such as fusion welding of polymers and surface wetting:

Installing flowermd
===================

Installing `flowermd` from the `conda-forge` channel can be achieved by adding `conda-forge` to your channels with:

```
conda config --add channels conda-forge
conda config --set channel_priority strict
```

Once the `conda-forge` channel has been enabled, `flowermd` can be installed with `conda`:

```
conda install flowermd
```

or with `mamba`:

```
mamba install flowermd
```

**Installing from source for development:**

Clone this repository:

```
git clone git@github.com:cmelab/flowerMD.git
cd flowerMD
```

Set up and activate environment:

```
conda env create -f environment-dev.yml
conda activate flowermd-dev
python -m pip install -e .
```

**A note on GPU compatibility:**

To install a GPU compatible version of HOOMD-blue in your flowerMD
environment, you need to manually set the CUDA version **before installing flowermd**.
This is to ensure that the HOOMD build pulled from conda-forge is compatible with your CUDA version.
To set the CUDA version, run the following command before installing flowermd:
```
export CONDA_OVERRIDE_CUDA="[YOUR_CUDA_VERSION]"
```
